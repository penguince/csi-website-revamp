### <a id="core-modules--responsibilities"></a>Core Modules & Responsibilities

The project follows a clear modular structure for better organization and separation of concerns:

*   **`src/main.tsx`**:
    *   The primary entry point of the React application. It mounts the `App` component into the `index.html` DOM.
*   **`src/App.tsx`**:
    *   The root component that sets up the React Router for client-side navigation. It defines all the main routes and renders the `Layout` component.
*   **`src/components/`**:
    *   Contains reusable UI components shared across different pages, such as `Header.tsx` (main navigation), `Footer.tsx` (site-wide footer), `Sidebar.tsx` (secondary navigation/side menu), and `Layout.tsx` (a wrapper component providing a consistent structure for pages).
*   **`src/pages/`**:
    *   Each file in this directory represents a distinct page of the website (e.g., `Home.tsx`, `Undergraduate.tsx`, `Faculty.tsx`). These components fetch and display the content specific to their respective sections.
*   **`src/index.css`**:
    *   Global styles, including Tailwind CSS imports and any custom base styles.
*   **`tailwind.config.js`**:
    *   Tailwind CSS configuration file, defining custom colors (`csi-blue`, `csi-dark`, `csi-gray`), theme extensions, and plugins.
*   **`vite.config.ts`**:
    *   Vite configuration file, handling build options, development server settings, and React-specific plugins.

## <a id="getting-started"></a>🚀 Getting Started

Follow these steps to get a local copy of the project up and running for development and testing.

### <a id="prerequisites"></a>📋 Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following software installed on your machine:

*   **Node.js**: `v18` or higher (recommended `v20.x`)
    *   [Download Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
*   **npm**: Included with Node.js, or [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install) (if preferred)

You can verify your Node.js and npm versions using:

```bash
node -v
npm -v
```

### <a id="installation-steps"></a>⚙️ Installation Steps

1.  **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/penguince/csi-website-revamp.git
    cd csi-website-revamp
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies**:
    ```bash
    npm install
    # or
    yarn install
    ```

### <a id="configuration"></a>🛠️ Configuration

The project uses several configuration files. Most development tasks won't require direct modification of these, but it's good to be aware of their purpose:

*   **`tailwind.config.js`**:
    *   Defines the custom color palette (`csi-blue`, `csi-dark`, `csi-gray`) and other Tailwind CSS specific settings.
    *   **💡 Tip**: If you introduce new custom colors or want to enable new Tailwind plugins, this is the file to edit.
*   **`vite.config.ts`**:
    *   Manages Vite's build process and development server. Includes the React plugin.
    *   **💡 Tip**: For advanced scenarios like proxying API requests (not currently used), configuring build outputs, or adding other Vite plugins, you'd modify this file.
*   **`tsconfig.json`**, `tsconfig.app.json`, `tsconfig.node.json`:
    *   TypeScript configuration files that define compiler options, type checking rules, and project references.
    *   **🔍 Note**: Ensure your IDE is using these `tsconfig` files for proper TypeScript IntelliSense and error checking.

### <a id="running-the-application"></a>🚀 Running the Application

#### Development Mode

To start the development server with hot-reloading:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

The application will typically be available at `http://localhost:5174/` (or another port if 5174 is in use). Check your terminal for the exact URL.

#### Building for Production

To create an optimized production build:

```bash
npm run build
# or
yarn build
```

This command compiles the TypeScript code, bundles the assets with Vite, and places the optimized output (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) into the `dist/` directory.

#### Previewing the Production Build

To locally serve and test the production build:

```bash
npm run preview
# or
yarn preview
```

This will start a local static server to serve the contents of the `dist/` folder, allowing you to see how the optimized application behaves before deployment.

## <a id="usage--workflows"></a>💡 Usage & Workflows

This section covers how users interact with the deployed application and common development workflows.

### <a id="navigating-the-site"></a>Navigating the Site

The application uses client-side routing, meaning navigation between pages is fast and doesn't require a full page reload.

*   **Main Navigation**:
    *   The `Header.tsx` component provides the primary navigation links to key sections like Home, Undergraduate, Graduate, Courses, Research, Faculty, and Resources.
    *   On smaller screens, a responsive menu (often a hamburger icon) will appear to toggle the navigation.
*   **Sidebar Navigation**:
    *   The `Sidebar.tsx` component (if active) offers additional or contextual navigation links, enhancing discoverability.
*   **Internal Links**:
    *   Content within pages may contain internal links to other sections or specific points on a page.

### <a id="common-development-workflows"></a>Common Development Workflows

#### Diagram: Adding a New Page

This flowchart illustrates the typical steps involved in creating and integrating a new content page into the website.

```

#### Adding a New Page

<details>
<summary>Click to expand detailed steps</summary>

1.  **Create the Page Component**:
    *   Inside `src/pages/`, create a new `.tsx` file (e.g., `Events.tsx`).
    *   Define your React component with the page's content.

    ```tsx
    // src/pages/Events.tsx
    import React from 'react';

    const Events: React.FC = () => {
        return (
            <div className="container mx-auto p-4">
                <h1 className="text-3xl font-bold text-csi-dark mb-4">Upcoming Events</h1>
                <p className="text-lg text-gray-700">Check back soon for exciting events from the CS Department!</p>
                {/* Add more event details here */}
            </div>
        );
    };

    export default Events;
    ```

2.  **Define the Route in `App.tsx`**:
    *   Open `src/App.tsx`.
    *   Import your new page component.
    *   Add a new `<Route>` element within `<Routes>`.

    ```tsx
    // src/App.tsx
    import { BrowserRouter as Router, Routes, Route } from 'react-router-dom';
    import Layout from './components/Layout';
    import Home from './pages/Home';
    // ... other page imports
    import Events from './pages/Events'; // Import your new page

    function App() {
        return (
            <Router>
                <Layout>
                    <Routes>
                        <Route path="/" element={<Home />} />
                        {/* ... other routes */}
                        <Route path="/events" element={<Events />} /> {/* Add the new route */}
                    </Routes>
                </Layout>
            </Router>
        );
    }

    export default App;
    ```

3.  **Add Navigation Link**:
    *   Open `src/components/Header.tsx` or `src/components/Sidebar.tsx`.
    *   Add a `<NavLink>` to your new page.

    ```tsx
    // src/components/Header.tsx (example)
    import { NavLink } from 'react-router-dom';
    // ...
    <nav className="flex space-x-4">
        <NavLink to="/" className={({ isActive }) => (isActive ? 'font-bold text-csi-blue' : 'hover:text-csi-blue')}>Home</NavLink>
        {/* ... other links */}
        <NavLink to="/events" className={({ isActive }) => (isActive ? 'font-bold text-csi-blue' : 'hover:text-csi-blue')}>Events</NavLink>
    </nav>
    ```

4.  **Test**:
    *   Run `npm run dev`.
    *   Navigate to the new route (`http://localhost:5174/events`) and click the new navigation link to ensure everything works correctly.

</details>

#### Modifying Styles

The project uses Tailwind CSS for styling. This means most styles are applied directly in the JSX via class names.

<details>
<summary>Click to expand detailed styling guidance</summary>

1.  **Utility-First Approach**:
    *   Apply classes like `text-csi-dark`, `p-4`, `flex`, `md:text-lg` directly to your HTML elements.
    *   **💡 Tip**: Use Tailwind's documentation ([tailwindcss.com/docs](https://tailwindcss.com/docs)) to find the appropriate utility classes.

2.  **Custom Colors**:
    *   The `tailwind.config.js` defines custom colors like `csi-blue`, `csi-dark`, `csi-gray`.
    *   Use them like any other Tailwind color: `bg-csi-blue`, `text-csi-dark`.

3.  **Responsive Design**:
    *   Use responsive prefixes (`sm:`, `md:`, `lg:`) to apply styles conditionally based on screen size.
    *   Example: `<div className="w-full md:w-1/2">` means the div takes full width on small screens, and half width on medium screens and up.

4.  **Global Styles**:
    *   `src/index.css` is where you can define global CSS, import Tailwind directives, or add custom CSS for elements that can't be styled effectively with utilities.
    *   **⚠️ Warning**: Try to keep global CSS to a minimum and prefer Tailwind utilities for consistency.

*   **Branch Naming**: Use descriptive names like `feature/add-search`, `bugfix/fix-mobile-header`, `refactor/component-x`.
*   **Commit Messages**: Follow a conventional commit style (e.g., `feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`, `chore:`, `refactor:`).
*   **Pull Requests**:
    *   Keep PRs focused on a single feature or bug fix.
    *   Ensure all tests pass and linting checks are green.
    *   Provide screenshots or GIFs for UI changes.
    *   Be open to feedback and collaborate during the review process.

### <a id="code-style--linting"></a>Code Style & Linting

*   **ESLint**: The project uses ESLint with TypeScript and React plugins to enforce code quality and style.
    *   You can run the linter manually: `npm run lint`
    *   **💡 Tip**: Most IDEs (like VS Code) have extensions that integrate ESLint, providing real-time feedback.
*   **TypeScript**: Adhere to strict TypeScript typing.
*   **Tailwind CSS**: Follow Tailwind's utility-first philosophy. Avoid writing custom CSS unless absolutely necessary.
*   **React Best Practices**:
    *   Keep components small and focused.
    *   Use functional components and React Hooks.
    *   Prefer prop drilling over context for simple data flows; use Context API for global state.

### <a id="frequently-asked-questions-faq"></a>Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

<details>
<summary>Q: How do I add new content to an existing page?</summary>
A: For existing pages, you'll need to directly edit the corresponding `.tsx` file in `src/pages/`. Locate the section you want to modify and update the JSX content. Remember to save your changes, and Vite's HMR (Hot Module Replacement) will update your browser instantly in development mode.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Q: Can I change the color scheme?</summary>
A: Yes! The primary colors are defined in `tailwind.config.js`. You can modify the values for `csi-blue`, `csi-dark`, `csi-gray`, or add new custom colors. After saving, Tailwind CSS will regenerate its utility classes, and your application will reflect the new colors.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Q: Why did you choose Vite over Webpack or Create React App?</summary>
A: Vite was chosen for its superior developer experience, significantly faster cold start times, and instant hot module replacement (HMR) thanks to its use of native ES modules. It provides a more modern and performant build setup compared to traditional bundlers like Webpack, especially for development.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Q: Is there a backend for this application?</summary>
A: No, this is a purely frontend application. All content is currently static and embedded within the React components. Future plans include integrating with a backend or headless CMS for dynamic content.

### <a id="troubleshooting-guide"></a>Troubleshooting Guide

<details>
<summary>Q: `npm install` fails or encounters errors.</summary>
A:
1.  **Check Node.js Version**: Ensure your Node.js version meets the `v18` or higher requirement.
2.  **Clear Cache**: Try clearing your npm cache: `npm cache clean --force` then retry `npm install`.
3.  **Delete `node_modules`**: Remove the `node_modules` directory and `package-lock.json` (or `yarn.lock`), then run `npm install` again.
4.  **Network Issues**: Check your internet connection, as `npm install` downloads packages from the registry.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Q: `npm run dev` doesn't start or shows an error.</summary>
A:
1.  **Dependencies Installed?**: Ensure you've run `npm install` successfully.
2.  **Port Conflict**: If the default port (`5174`) is in use, Vite will usually suggest another one. Check your terminal output. If you explicitly want to change it, you can configure it in `vite.config.ts`.
3.  **Syntax Errors**: Check your recent code changes for any TypeScript or JavaScript syntax errors. The terminal output will usually point to the problematic file and line number.
4.  **Corrupted `node_modules`**: Try deleting `node_modules` and `package-lock.json` (or `yarn.lock`), then `npm install` and `npm run dev` again.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Q: Tailwind CSS styles are not applying.</summary>
A:
1.  **Check `tailwind.config.js` `content`**: Ensure that the `content` array in `tailwind.config.js` correctly includes all paths where you use Tailwind classes (`./index.html`, `./src/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}`).
2.  **Import in `index.css`**: Verify that `@tailwind` directives are correctly imported in `src/index.css`:
    ```css
    @tailwind base;
    @tailwind components;
    @tailwind utilities;
    ```
3.  **Rebuild/Restart Dev Server**: Sometimes, Tailwind's JIT mode needs a restart (`npm run dev`) to pick up new configurations or classes.
